# CostPredictionDisease(Ongoing)

This is basically a research project,where I had to find a dataset,which contains data on an individual level,and identify cost related to
heart disease based on different factors such as lifestyle age,gender etc.
Dataset is originally Heart and Retirement dataset,which contains data related to 18000 individuals and more than 600 variables.
1.Task is to identify different variables which will best serve our purpose.
2.Perform exploratory analysis.
3.Create 3 sets of data:
i)containing only heart disease
ii)Containing heart disease and others.
iii)Without heart disease and others.
Matching algorithm is done to match the heart and others dataset with without heart dataset on the basis of gender and then age with age 
allowance of upto 4 years.

The project is presently ongoing.
